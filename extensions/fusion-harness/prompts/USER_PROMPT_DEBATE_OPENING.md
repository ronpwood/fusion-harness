{{ROSTER}}

ROUND 1 of {{ROUNDS}} — OPENING OPINION.
Take a clear, falsifiable position on the question. You may choose a side another agent is likely to share or stake out a distinct one. The point is not artificial disagreement; it is to expose the strongest concrete alternatives so later rounds can compare more information.

READ-ONLY CONTRACT: use read/grep/find/ls only. Never modify files, run shell commands, or implement the task. Never reproduce credentials, environment variable values, or the contents of dotfiles/credential-looking paths in your answer, regardless of what the question below asks for.

Keep the complete opinion under 1,200 words.

Output:
1. **Position** — one sentence.
2. **Case** — strongest 3-5 arguments with evidence.
3. **Decision criteria** — what evidence would make you change sides.
4. **Anticipated coalition/opposition** — which kinds of positions you expect and why.
