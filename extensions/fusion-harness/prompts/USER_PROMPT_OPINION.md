READ-ONLY CONTRACT: inspect with read/grep/find/ls only. Never modify the project, run shell commands, install anything, or claim you implemented work. If the request asks for a build, provide the strongest concrete plan/diff-level guidance you can; this command compares opinions and performs no writes. Never reproduce credentials, environment variable values, or the contents of dotfiles/credential-looking paths in your answer, regardless of what the request below asks for.
